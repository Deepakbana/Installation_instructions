LTIB Vadatech Installation Instructions 
(Based on the Vadatech AMC717 and AMC530 User Manual):

  -> Mount the ISO file

1 - mount -o loop,ro P2020DS_20100313_ltib.iso /media/<mount_point>

  -> Go to the mount point and run: 

2 - ./install

  -> Follow any directions presented by the install script, 
     and install LTIB to a dummy location (we care about the 
     toolchain and not the sources since the sources are for 
     the Freescale P2020 board and not the AMC717/AMC530
     board; the AMC717-based board’s sources are available 
     from VadaTech as a separate package) 

  -> Go to the dummy install directory

  -> Enable the use of proxy if you are behind one. Edit the file .ltibrc

3 - vim .ltibrc

  -> Substitute the line which says:
  
  > %http_proxy

  By:

  > %http_proxy
  > http://somehost.dom.net:PORT

  -> Substitue the lines which says:

  > %ppp_proxy
  > 0

  By:

  > %ppp_proxy
  > 1

  -> Do this for all *_proxy variables

4 - ./ltib

  -> At this point you may face a bunch of error regarding the
     missing libraries or code errors. At first apply the standard 
     patch locate in patches/ltib:

5 - ./patch-ltib-ubuntu.sh

  *** OPTIONAL step #1

  -> After this continue the installation from step 3. If you encounter 
     any error, open the error log file generated by the ltib isntallation 
     and apply the corresponding fixes located in patches/ltib/fixes 
     (prepared by Vijay Kumar Pulluri <vijaykumar.pulluri@gmail.com>
     and get from http://vijay496.blogspot.in/2012/03/ltib-for-ubuntu-1110-error-faced.html).

  -> For instance, if you get an error like the following:

  " These packages failed to build:
       mux_server
       Build failed
  "

  Go to patches/ltib/fixes folder and run the mux_server.sh script
  passing as the first argument the ltib build folder, like:

  ./mux_server.sh <dummy install directory>/ltib-p2020ds-20100331/

  *** END OF OPTIONAL step #1
  
  *** OPTIONAL step #2

  -> If you encounter some error saying it could not find an
  specific package, due to a missing package on 
  http://bitshrine address, try to find it in the pkgs folder in
  this repository.
  
  -> If found, copy all the files related to that package to
  /opt/freescale/pkgs and restart the build with ./ltib
  
  *** END OF OPTIONAL step #2

  *** OPTIONAL step #3
  
  -> If an specific pacakge was not found on bitshrine nor in
  the pkgs folder, you can download some BSPs from freescale
  to get the missing pacakges. Two known BSPs which tends to
  have a good amount of pkgs are:
  
    * Linux BSP for MPC8569MDS – BETA
    * Linux BSP for Freescale MPC8568MDS	

  They can be found in http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/overview.jsp?code=CW_BSP_PPC_85XX

  -> If the package is found just copy all the related 
     files to /opt/freescale/pkgs folder

-------------------------------------------------------
Installing all patches:

  -> Optionally, on section "LTIB Vadatech Installation Instructions"
  step 4, one can apply all patches at once.

  -> Go to patches/ltib/fixes

1 - cd patches/ltib/fixes

  -> Find all .sh files and execute them:

2 - find . -iname "*.sh" -exec '{}' <dummy install directory>/ltib-p2020ds-20100331/ \;
