LTIB Vadatech Installation Instructions 
(Based on the Vadatech AMC717 and AMC530 User Manual):

  -> Mount the ISO file

1 - mount -o loop,ro P2020DS_20100313_ltib.iso /media/<mount_point>

  -> Go to the mount point and run: 

2 - ./install

  -> Follow any directions presented by the install script, 
     and install LTIB to a dummy location (we care about the 
     toolchain and not the sources since the sources are for 
     the Freescale P2020 board and not the AMC717/AMC530
     board; the AMC717-based boardâ€™s sources are available 
     from VadaTech as a separate package) 

  -> Go to the dummy install directory

3 - ./ltib

  -> At this point you may face a bunch of error regarding the
     missing libraries or code errors. At first apply the standard 
     patch locate in patches/ltib:

4 - ./patch-ltib-ubuntu.sh

  -> After this continue the installation from step 3. If you encounter 
     any error, open the error log file generated by the ltib isntallation 
     and apply the corresponding fixes located in patches/ltib/fixes 
     (prepared by Vijay Kumar Pulluri <vijaykumar.pulluri@gmail.com>
     and get from http://vijay496.blogspot.in/2012/03/ltib-for-ubuntu-1110-error-faced.html).

  -> For instance, if you get an error like the following:

  " These packages failed to build:
       mux_server
       Build failed
  "

  Go to patches/ltib/fixes folder and run the mux_server.sh script
  passing as the first argument the ltib build folder, like:

  ./mux_server.sh <dummy install directory>/ltib-p2020ds-20100331/
