This folder contains all the issues I faced when building ltib on my Ubuntu host 11.10
If you face any of these error during Ltib building in your 11.10

Please run the appropriate command given below.

be careful while giving ltib path while running commands 

ltib path is that which you have given during installing ltib 

for me it is /home/cmc/ltibsetup/ltib it must contain all the folders like bin,config,dist,doc.....
So it look like
  cmc@cmc-ThinkCentre-M71e:~/ltibsetup/ltib $ ls
   bin     COPYING  doc   host_config.log  README        rootfs      rpm
   config  dist     hash  ltib             RELEASE_INFO  rootfs.tmp  tmp
  so I will run like ./sparse.sh /home/cmc/ltibsetup/ltib

After downloading this folder enter into this folder and run the appropriate command where u faced error
please check if any permission denied aspects while running scripts
give them execute permissions by eg : chmod +x rpmdb.sh

rpmdb: --force-debian  :  ./rpmdb.sh <give your ltib path>
